# Appendix A: Origin Note

## Development Context

This governance architecture emerged from collaborative analysis of embodied agent failure modes across multiple AI systems.

The analysis examined failure surfaces across multiple categories:
- Physical resistance and hidden constraints
- Latent material degradation
- False-positive outcomes
- Specification-level impossibility
- Belief volatility from direct learning

The architecture was refined through iterative discussion, with each layer addressing a distinct failure class identified during analysis.

## Key Insight

The central insight — that caution should be queried rather than internalized — emerged from examining why capable agents fail in imperfect environments despite correct reasoning.

Externalizing skepticism into versioned reference libraries resolves the tension between operational capability and appropriate restraint.

This architecture reflects collaborative analysis across multiple AI systems with human oversight, synthesized into the formal structure presented in this repository.
